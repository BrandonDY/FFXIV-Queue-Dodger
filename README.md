On server 2002 error, relaunches the game and puts you back into queue

Works with both the default launcher and FFXIV Quick Launcher but works better and faster with the Quick Launcher. Change the quickLauncher variable on line 10 to 0 if you are not using quick launcher. Quick Launcher users edit lines 27 and 94 to reflect the location of your XIVLauncher.exe. Standard launcher users edit lines 33 and 100 to do the same. Standard launcher users must input their password on line 104. The intended use currently for the standard launcher is to only input the password as it assumes you've checked "Remember Square Enix ID".
